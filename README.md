✅ Project Title: Deploying Dockerized App on Kubernetes using ArgoCD and GitOps methodology with Github Actions

✅ Step 1: Set Up Your Kubernetes Cluster
Create an Kubernetes cluster if you don't already have one.You can create Kubernetes cluster in aws eks, azure aks or your vm

✅ Step 2: Containerize Your Application
 Dockerize your application by creating a Dockerfile that defines how your application should be packaged as a container. Build and push the Docker image to docker hub or docker registry.

✅ Step 3: Set Up ArgoCD
 ☑️ Install ArgoCD in your Kubernetes cluster. You can use the ArgoCD CLI or apply Kubernetes manifests to deploy it.
☑️ Configure ArgoCD to connect to your Git repository where your application manifests (Kubernetes YAML files) are stored.

✅ Step 4: Define Your Application in ArgoCD
 ☑️ Create an ArgoCD Application resource that describes your application and references the Git repository and specific branch or tag to monitor for changes.
☑️ Configure the sync policy to automatically apply changes when the Git repository is updated.

✅ Step 5: Set Up Github Action
☑️ Create a git workflow  your application's in Git repository.
☑️ Configure your git workflow to trigger when changes are pushed to the Git repository.
☑️ Within your git workflow, create job test code .

☑️ Authenticate you docker hub or docker registry .
☑️ Build and push your Docker image to your docker hub or registry.
☑️ Update build image tag this git repository that repository have kubernetes yaml.

✅ Step 6: GitOps Workflow
Developers make changes to your application code or configuration in the Git repository.
☑️ Push changes to the Git repository. This triggers the git  build and deployment workflow.
☑️  git workflow builds the Docker image, pushes it to docker hub or registry .
☑️ ArgoCD, which is continuously monitoring the Git repository, detects the ☑️ changes and automatically synchronizes the deployed application state with the desired state defined in your Git repository.

✅ Conclsion: We used ArgoCD and the GitOps approach with Git to deploy a dockerized application on an Kubernetes cluster. This gave us a strong base for our deployment. After that, we made the pipeline work with  GitHub Workflow. This ensured our Kubernetes setups and the CI/CD process worked smoothly.
